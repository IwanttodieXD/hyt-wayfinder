/**
 * Entrance verification.
 *
 * Reached by scanning the QR poster at the front desk. Asks for the trainee's
 * first and last name, looks them up against the roster, and routes on the
 * result:
 *
 *   found + approved  -> sign them in and send them to check-in
 *   found + declined  -> explain, point at the front desk
 *   found + pending   -> explain, point at the front desk
 *   found + expired   -> explain, ask for a renewal (never sent to check-in)
 *   not found         -> /register, prefilled with what they typed
 *   ambiguous         -> explain, send to the front desk (two people, one name)
 *
 * HOW THEY ARE SIGNED IN
 * ----------------------
 * No email and no link. `requestVerifyLogin` calls /api/verify, which resolves
 * the name + course against the roster and - only when the record is approved or
 * already recognized - mints a real Supabase session for the matched account
 * (service-role `generateLink` + `verifyOtp`). This page installs it with
 * `setSession`, refreshes the auth store, and lands on /check-in, where the
 * trainee is checked in automatically.
 *
 * A record with no email on file is signed in the same way: the route derives a
 * synthetic, non-deliverable login address from the profile id, so a missing
 * address is no longer a reason to send anyone to the front desk.
 *
 * SECURITY TRADEOFF
 * -----------------
 * The email step used to be what proved identity: the magic link showed the
 * visitor controlled the mailbox on file. It has been removed at the owner's
 * request, so the name + course pair - which is printed on the orientation
 * roster - is now the only thing needed to obtain a session. Anyone who knows a
 * colleague's name and course can sign in as them. The server route is the one
 * place to add rate limiting, an audit trail, or a per-person secret if that
 * becomes unacceptable; see app/api/verify/route.ts.
 *
 * The EMAIL IS NEVER TYPED HERE: it is read back off the matched row, so the
 * person at the door cannot redirect the session at somebody else.
 *
 * ADMIN DOORWAY
 * -------------
 * Typing the two names in ADMIN_SHORTCUT below jumps to /login instead of
 * looking anyone up. It is a redirect, not a credential: /login still requires
 * a real signed-in account.
