/**
 * Wayfinding route registry.
 *
 * There are two kinds of QR code in this system, and they are deliberately
 * different things:
 *
 * 1. ATTENDANCE - exactly one code, printed at the ground floor station.
 *    Scanning it is the only way to clock in or out. It carries no room, so
 *    which route to draw comes from the person's assigned destination instead.
 *
 * 2. ROOM PRESENCE - one code per room, posted on that room's door. Scanning
 *    one only records that the person is inside that room right now. It never
 *    touches attendance, so a visitor cannot clock themselves out by scanning
 *    the wrong poster.
 *
 * Attendance codes are `HYT-KIOSK-<station>` and room codes are
 * `HYT-ROOM-<room>:<ROOM_ID>`. The prefixes are what `parseQrValue` keys off,
 * so the two can never be mistaken for one another.
